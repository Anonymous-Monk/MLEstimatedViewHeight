 MLEstimatedViewHeight provides two ways to get the height of the view constraint.
 
 *You can get it directly through the mlHeight property, This way you can calculate the height immediately.
 *Or get it through mlHeightBlock, This method is used to asynchronously calculate more complex views for improved performance.
